# Fridge Cop

## What Is It?

Me just trying to do simple REST service to call via IFTTT when it receives on/off signals from my IOT door open sensor. Idea is to use this to trigger alarm if fridge door is left open for more than N minutes. This is just fastly written PoC, free free to steal and adapt if useful.
